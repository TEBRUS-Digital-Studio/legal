# Privacy Policy for TEBRUS

**Last Updated:** November 29, 2025

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **TEBRUS** ("we," "our," or "us"). TEBRUS is a sports prediction simulation application developed by the **TEBRUS Digital Studio** (France).

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App") and our website [https://tebrus.co.site](https://tebrus.co.site).

### Nature of the Service
TEBRUS operates as a **Free-to-Play Rewards Program**.
*   **Social Prediction:** Users make predictions on sports events using virtual points called **"TEBCOINS"**. TEBCOINS are earned through engagement (e.g., watching ads, completing missions) and have **no monetary value**.
*   **Non-Monetary Participation:** No purchase, deposit, or payment of real money is ever required to participate. There is no risk of financial loss.
*   **Rewards:** Successful predictions allow users to accumulate **"TEBREWS"**. TEBREWS are reward points that may be redeemed for vouchers or gift cards, subject to our Terms of Service.

By accessing our Service, you agree to the collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Age Restriction (18+)

**This Service is intended exclusively for users aged eighteen (18) years or older.**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 18.
*   **Target Audience:** The App is designed for a mature audience and is not marketed to children.
*   **Compliance:** If we identify an account belonging to a minor, we will delete the account and all associated data immediately to comply with child protection regulations.

If you believe we hold information about a user under 18, please contact us at `contact@tebrus.co.site`.

## 3. Information We Collect

We adhere to the principle of data minimization. We only collect data that is necessary for the App to function, to prevent fraud, and to provide rewards.

### A. Information You Voluntarily Provide
*   **Account Registration (Google Sign-In):** We collect basic profile information to create your unique user ID and secure your wallet:
    *   Email Address (Required for account recovery and payout communication).
    *   Full Name (as provided by Google).
    *   Profile Picture (Optional, for user interface display).
*   **Payout Information:** When you exchange "TEBREWS" for rewards, we collect the necessary contact details to deliver the reward (e.g., a valid email address for digital gift cards). We never ask for credit card numbers or banking passwords.
*   **Survey & Demographic Data (TheoremReach & BitLabs):** When you participate in Rewarded Surveys via our partners TheoremReach or BitLabs, you may be asked to provide demographic information (such as gender, postal code, year of birth, employment status, etc.) to qualify for specific surveys.
    *   **Voluntary:** Providing this data is entirely voluntary, but necessary to match you with surveys relevant to your profile.
    *   **Processing:** This data is collected directly by these partners within their secure interfaces. TEBRUS does not store your detailed survey answers on our own servers, but we may receive a generic "User Profile" status or metadata to help filter opportunities.
*   **Customer Support:** If you contact us via email, we collect your email address and the message content.

### B. Information Collected Automatically
To operate the "Free-to-Play" model (awarding TEBCOINS for interactions), certain data is collected automatically by our third-party partners:
*   **Device Information:** Device model, operating system version, time zone, and language.
*   **Identifiers:** Advertising ID (GAID/AAID) and IP address. These are used to validate that you have completed an offer (e.g., "Reach level 5 in Game X") to credit your TEBCOINS.
*   **Usage Stats & Installed Apps (Specific to Offerwalls):** Partners like PlayTimeAds (PlayTime) reward you based on the time played in other games. To do this, they require access to your app usage history (Android Usage Access). This data is strictly used to calculate your rewards in real-time. You will be asked for explicit, opt-in consent before this data is accessed.

## 4. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:
1.  **Authentication:** To manage your identity via Google OAuth.
2.  **Game Mechanics:** To track your "TEBCOINS" balance, your prediction history, and your "TEBREWS" earnings.
3.  **Reward Fulfillment:** To verify your identity and deliver your earned rewards.
4.   **Monetization & Survey Matching:** To display advertisements and **match you with relevant market research surveys** (via TheoremReach) based on your demographic profile.
5.   **Fraud Prevention & Data Quality:** To detect cheating, use of bots, multiple account abuse, **or bad-faith survey responses (e.g., inconsistent answers)** which may lead to reward reversals.
6.  **Support:** To answer your inquiries via our NEO email services.

## 5. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal data to data brokers. We share data with trusted third-party service providers solely to operate the App's ecosystem.
