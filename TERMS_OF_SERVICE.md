# Terms of Service for TEBRUS

**Last Updated:** November 29, 2025

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the **TEBRUS** mobile application (the "App") or website, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Service.

TEBRUS is developed and operated by **TEBRUS Digital Studio** (Individual Developer based in France).

## 2. Eligibility & Age Restriction

The Service is strictly limited to users who are **eighteen (18) years of age or older**.
*   By creating an account, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old.
*   We reserve the right to request proof of age. Accounts found to belong to minors will be permanently suspended.

## 3. Nature of the Service (Social Simulation)

TEBRUS is a **free-to-play sports prediction simulation**.
*   **Absolutely No In-App Deposits:** It is technically impossible to deposit real money into the TEBRUS App. There is no "Cashier" or "Deposit" function.
*   **No Purchase Necessary:** Participation is entirely funded by advertisements and engagement.
*   **Not a Gambling Operator:** TEBRUS is NOT a sportsbook or a gambling platform. We do not accept wagers of real money. The Service is for entertainment purposes only.
*   **Platform Disclaimer:** Apple Inc. and Google LLC are NOT sponsors of, nor are they involved in any way with, the contests, predictions, or rewards provided in the TEBRUS App. The rewards are solely provided by TEBRUS Digital Studio.

## 4. Virtual Currencies

The App uses a dual-currency system of virtual items.

### A. TEBCOINS (Game Points)
*   **Definition:** Virtual points used solely to participate in prediction simulations.
*   **No Monetary Value:** TEBCOINS have **zero cash value**. They cannot be exchanged for money.
*   **Strictly Non-Purchasable:** **You cannot buy TEBCOINS with real money from TEBRUS.** They are only earned through gameplay (ads, missions).

### B. TEBREWS (Reward Points)
*   **Definition:** Loyalty points accumulated by correct predictions.
*   **Redemption:** Can be redeemed for vouchers/gift cards subject to verification.
*   **Non-Transferable:** You cannot sell, trade, or transfer TEBREWS to other users.

### C. General Currency Rules
*   **Inactivity & Expiration:** If an account remains inactive (no login) for a period of six (6) consecutive months, TEBRUS reserves the right to expire and remove all accumulated TEBCOINS and TEBREWS without notice.
*   **Valuation Changes:*** TEBRUS reserves the right to modify the exchange rate between TEBREWS and real-world  rewards at any time without prior notice, based on economic factors or partnership changes.
*   **Negative Balance:** In the event of a chargeback or reversal initiated by a third-party provider (as described in Sec. 7), your TEBCOINS balance may become negative. You must earn enough TEBCOINS to return to a positive balance before being able to redeem any rewards.

## 5. Prediction Rules & Fair Play Integrity

To maintain a fair ecosystem, strict integrity rules apply to all predictions. **TEBRUS reserves the right to invalidate (cancel) any prediction results** in the following cases:

### A. Data Feed Errors
If a prediction is placed on outcomes that display clearly incorrect data due to a technical glitch (e.g., inverted probability values or displaying a score that has already happened), the prediction will be invalidated.

### B. Late Predictions (Past Post)
If a prediction is recorded after the actual start time of the sporting event (due to network latency or server delay), the prediction is invalid, as the outcome may already be known.

### C. System Exploitation & Abuse
We prohibit all forms of gameplay abuse intended to bypass the simulation mechanics, including:
*   **Pattern Exploitation:** Using mathematical exploits to guarantee a profit regardless of the sport outcome (e.g., placing contradictory predictions on multiple accounts).
*   **Glitch Abuse:** Knowingly exploiting a software bug to generate currency.
*   **Syndicate Activity:** Multiple users acting in concert to manipulate the leaderboard or reward pool.

**Decision Authority:** TEBRUS Digital Studio has the final sole discretion to determine if a user's activity constitutes System Exploitation.

## 6. Third-Party Offers & Surveys

You may earn TEBCOINS by completing tasks, playing games, or answering surveys via third-party partners (e.g., BitLabs, PubScale, PlayTimeAds/PlayTime, TheoremReach, PaymentWall).
*   **PlayTime Tracking Requirement:** For time-based gaming rewards (PlayTime), you acknowledge that valid tracking permissions (Usage Access) must be enabled on your device. If you deny these permissions or if the tracking fails due to battery saver modes or technical constraints, TEBRUS cannot verify your playtime and is not liable to credit rewards.
*   **External Transactions:** Some third-party tasks may reward you for actions taken in other applications (e.g., "Reach Level 10" or "Make a purchase in Game X").
*   **Survey Disqualifications (Screenouts):** When participating in market research surveys (e.g., via TheoremReach), you acknowledge that you may be disqualified at any stage if your profile does not match the specific demographic criteria required by the researcher. TEBRUS is not responsible for time spent on surveys that result in a disqualification or a partial reward.
*   **Disclaimer on Purchases:** TEBRUS NEVER requires you to spend money. If you choose to complete a third-party task that involves a purchase in another app, this is a voluntary transaction between you and that third-party. TEBRUS is not a party to that transaction and will not issue refunds for purchases made outside of our App.
*   **Content Liability:** We do not endorse the content of third-party ads (which may include other games or services). Interaction is at your own risk.
*   **Partner Validation Policy:** TEBRUS credits TEBCOINS only when we receive a valid confirmation and payment from our advertising partners. If a partner rejects a conversion due to their own fraud checks or tracking issues, TEBRUS bears no liability to credit the user.

## 7. Anti-Fraud & Conduct

**You agree NOT to:**
1.  Use **VPNs**, Proxies, or location masking tools (strictly prohibited by our advertising partners).
2.  Use **Emulators** or rooted/jailbroken devices.
3.  Create **multiple accounts** (Multi-accounting is considered fraud).
4.  Use bots, scripts, or auto-clickers.
5.  Submit **False Information** in Surveys: Providing inconsistent answers, speeding through surveys (answering faster than humanly possible), or using fake demographic data is strictly prohibited.
6.  **Profile Manipulation** (BitLabs/Surveys): You agree to provide truthful demographic information in the initial profilers. Repeatedly changing your profile data (e.g., changing age or gender) to qualify for more surveys is considered fraud and will lead to a ban.

**Consequences & Chargebacks:**
*   **Suspension:** Violation of these rules will result in an **immediate account suspension**.
*   **Point Revocation (Chargebacks):** You acknowledge that our partners (e.g., TheoremReach) monitor response quality. If a partner issues a "Reversal" or "Chargeback" due to poor quality responses or fraudulent activity detected post-reward, TEBRUS reserves the right to **deduct the corresponding TEBCOINS** from your balance, potentially resulting in a negative balance.

## 8. Rewards, Payouts, and Refund Policy
**A. Verification & Payouts**
All redemption requests undergo a security review (up to 7 business days). We may deny a reward if fraud, system exploitation (as defined in Sec. 5), or breach of terms is detected.

**B. Refund Policy**
Since TEBRUS operates on a strictly "Free-to-Play" model where no real money deposits or purchases are allowed:

1. **No Refunds:** As no goods or services are sold by TEBRUS for fiat currency, there are no refunds, returns, or chargebacks applicable to the Service.
2. **Third-Party Transactions:** If you voluntarily choose to spend money in a third-party game (e.g., via an Offerwall task to "Make a Purchase"), this transaction is solely between you and the third-party developer. TEBRUS cannot issue refunds for external transactions.
3. **Offerwall Disputes:** If you believe you completed a task via a partner (e.g., Paymentwall) but were not rewarded, you must contact that partner's support team directly. TEBRUS cannot manually validate third-party completion statuses.

## 9. Intellectual Property

All content (code, design, logo) is the property of TEBRUS Digital Studio.

## 10. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Service is provided "AS IS". We do not guarantee continuous availability or the accuracy of sports data. We are not liable for server outages.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

TEBRUS Digital Studio is not liable for indirect damages or for the actions of third-party advertisers.

## 12. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of **France**.
